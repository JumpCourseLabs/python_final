# Python Employee Management System Final

**Michael Phelps for Congnixia JUMP DevOps Program**
Notes:

- All functionality has been use-tested - The database is persistent in an off-site MySQL database.
  I know I can obfuscate database details with python-dotenv, but for the sake of this exercise, I created a standalone DB on freeMySQLHosting

- I think I got every facet of the MVP, and if I missed something, please let me know.
